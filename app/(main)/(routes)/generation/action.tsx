/**
 *** This file defines the AI actions for the application using the Generative UI framework provided by the Vercel AI SDK.
 *** Generative UI allows the AI to control parts of the UI, making it more interactive and dynamic.
 *** The AI and UI states are managed separately, allowing for a clear separation of concerns.
 *** The 'createAI' function from the 'ai/rsc' module is used to create the AI with the defined actions and initial states.
